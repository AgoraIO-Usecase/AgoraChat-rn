# Get started with Agora Chat UIKit

Instant messaging connects people wherever they are and allows them to communicate with others in real time. With built-in user interfaces (UI) for the message list, the [Agora Chat UI Samples](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-chat/get-started/get-started-uikit?platform=react-native) enables you to quickly embed real-time messaging into your app without requiring extra effort on the UI.

This page shows a sample code to add peer-to-peer messaging into your app by using the Agora Chat UI Samples.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow of how clients send and receive peer-to-peer messages:

![agora_chat](https://docs.agora.io/en/assets/images/get-started-sdk-understand-009486abec0cc276183ab535456cf889.png)

1. Clients retrieve a token from your app server.
2. Client A and Client B log in to Agora Chat.
3. Client A sends a message to Client B. The message is sent to the Agora Chat server and the server delivers the message to Client B. When Client B receives the message, the SDK triggers an event. Client B listens for the event and gets the message.

## Prerequisites

- react-native: 0.66.0 or later
- nodejs: 16.18.0 or later

For testing purposes, Agora Console supports generating Agora chat tokens. To generate an Agora chat token, do the following:

1. On the **Project Management** page, click **Config** for the project you want to use.
